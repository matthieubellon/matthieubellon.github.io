Tax capacity is fundamental to state-building and sustainable development. Achieving a tax-to-GDP ratio of at least 15 percent—endorsed by the UN’s Compromiso de Sevilla—is critical for institutional strength, financial market depth, and economic growth. However, many developing countries fall short of this benchmark, with 71 nations below the threshold, including fragile states and resource-rich economies. Comprehensive tax reform could mobilize an additional 5 percent of GDP in revenue, though institutional capacity remains a key constraint. The ‘tax system approach’—integrating tax policy, law, and administration—is essential for effective revenue mobilization. Reform strategies include broadening tax bases, improving indirect taxes, rationalizing incentives, and simplifying tax design. Enhancing compliance involves cultivating taxpayer trust, simplifying procedures, managing compliance risks, and leveraging digital tools. Strong governance and leadership underpin successful revenue administration. Ultimately, building tax capacity is a domestic political endeavor, supported by international capacity development. The IMF plays a central role through integrated support, exemplified by the Global Public Finance Partnership, which aligns domestic revenue mobilization with the Sustainable Development Goals.

<strong> Tax capacity</strong> is central to state capacity and sustainable development. Recent research suggests that
developing countries should aim for a tax-to-GDP ratio of at least 15 percent—enshrined in the United Nations
(UN) Compromiso de Sevilla (Seville Commitment)1—to achieve stronger institutions, deeper financial markets,
and sustainable economic growth.
  <br>  <br>
<strong> Tax revenue</strong> in many developing countries remains persistently below 15 percent, with little progress over the
past decade. Today, 71 developing countries have tax-to-GDP ratios below 15 percent. Of these, 23 are fragile
and conflict-affected states (FCSs), 38 are resource rich, and 40 are in the low-income group. Estimates
suggest that low-income developing countries could on average mobilize about 5 percent of GDP in additional
tax revenues through comprehensive reform of their tax system. Yet many in this group will need to further
improve their institutional capacity to reach a 15 percent tax-to-GDP ratio.
  <br>  <br>
<strong> Tax system approach.</strong> Effective revenue mobilization requires close integration of tax policy, tax law, and
revenue administration—reflected in what has come to be known in the tax literature as the “tax system
approach.” Grounded in this approach, the medium-term revenue strategy offers a comprehensive reform path
to achieve tax ratios of at least 15 percent of GDP. However, many low-income developing countries, especially
FCSs, may need to start with a more pragmatic, sequenced approach as discussed in this IMF Departmental
Paper. Options for tax design and revenue administration include the following:
  <br>  <br>
<strong> Tax Design</strong>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Base broadening:</strong> International experience shows revenue is best mobilized by broadening the tax
base—through rationalizing tax expenditures, improving value-added tax (VAT) design, and limiting
exemptions—rather than by raising already high statutory tax rates on compliant taxpayers.</li>
<li> <strong> Improving indirect taxes:</strong> VAT often underperforms in low-tax countries where rationalizing
exemptions and preferential rates could nearly double revenue. Excises are easy to administer and
justified by health or environmental goals, with untapped potential in developing economies.</li>
<li> <strong> Reforming tax incentives:</strong> Investment tax holidays and exemptions are often ineffective and costly.
Cheaper alternatives are investment credits and accelerated depreciation.</li>
<li> <strong> Simple taxes.</strong> Tax design could initially prioritize simplicity and feasibility as administrative capacity is
being developed, for example, by using taxes with a few collection points and final withholding taxes.</li>
<li> <strong> Diversifying revenue sources:</strong> Personal income tax expansion, stronger natural resource taxation,
and property taxes can mobilize revenue in equitable ways.</li>
</ul>  

<strong> Tax Compliance</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong> Cultivating tax compliance.</strong> Governments can promote tax compliance by establishing administrative
presence in the whole country, investing in tax education programs, working in partnership with other
government agencies and civil society organizations, and promoting open communication on tax issues.</li>
<li><strong> Simplicity and practicality.</strong> There are broad benefits to the revenue administration and to taxpayers from
adopting clear norms, transparent rulings, simple tax forms, harmonized procedures, user-friendly IT systems,
and easy collection entry points.</li>
<li><strong> Compliance risk management.</strong> Differentiating taxpayers based on their size and compliance behavior is an
effective approach, including combining large taxpayer offices to secure revenue for relevant economic
sectors with streamlined administration for small taxpayers to encourage formalization and “normalize”
compliance.</li>
<li><strong> Digitalization.</strong> Adopting simple and flexible digital solutions that can be expandable over time, starting with
core functions (for example, registration, return filing, payments) for large taxpayers can be especially
effective in low-capacity environments.</li>
<li><strong> Governance.</strong> Promoting capable and consistent leadership, adopting clear rules governing integrity,
engaging in financial management and reporting, implementing strong internal and external oversight
functions, investing in recruiting and training people based on meritocratic principles, and managing through
goals setting and performance monitoring are the foundation for good governance of revenue institutions and
are key to encouraging tax morale and taxpayer compliance.</li>
</ul>  
  
<strong> Building tax capacity </strong>  is ultimately a domestic political process, rooted in each country’s social contract. Yet
capacity development—through technical advice, training, and peer learning—has proven effective in
strengthening tax systems, particularly in low-income and FCSs. Tax capacity building is a central part of the
IMF’s work and integrated with surveillance and lending. To maximize impact, it is comprehensive, country-led,
and aligned with broader fiscal and macroeconomic reforms. The new Global Public Finance Partnership
embodies this approach, coordinating international support to help countries mobilize domestic revenue and
advance the Sustainable Development Goals, as emphasized in the Compromiso de Sevilla.

<br><strong>Economic Principles for Integrating Adaptation to Climate Change into Fiscal Policy,</strong> March 2022, <strong>

Adaptation to climate change is a necessity for advanced and developing economies alike. Policymakers face the challenge 
  of facilitating this transition. This Note argues that adaptation to climate change should be part of a holistic 
  development strategy involving both private and public sector responses. Governments can prioritize public investment 
  in adaptation programs with positive externalities, address market imperfections and policies that make private 
  adaptation inefficient, and mobilize revenues for, and distribute the benefits of, adaptation. Although the choice of 
  what should be done and at what cost ultimately depends on each society’s preferences, economic theory provides a 
  useful framework to maximize the impact of public spending. Cost-benefit analysis, complemented by the analysis of 
  distributional effects, can be used to prioritize adaptation programs as well as all other development programs to 
  promote an efficient and just transition to a changed climate. While compensations may be needed to offset damages 
  that are either impossible or too expensive to abate, subsidies for adaptation require careful calibration to prevent 
  excessive risk taking.

<div class="content">
Adaptation reduces climate change damages but is costly and cannot eliminate all risks. Governments have to decide on 
  an acceptable balance of residual risks and to determine adaptation investment needs by weighing costs, benefits, 
  and distributional effects. A literature review suggests that well-designed and well-implemented adaptation can have 
  large returns. Global public adaptation needs in 2030 are estimated in the literature at around ¼ percent of world 
  GDP per year, but with very large disparities across countries and high uncertainty. Our analysis points to annual 
  adaptation costs exceeding 1 percent of GDP for some developing countries, and above 10 percent of GDP for some 
  island states. Many of these countries—despite typically not having contributed to global warming—face high adaptation 
  needs while being challenged by limited fiscal space, limited capacity, or both, calling for additional support from 
  the international community. To help guide national fiscal policies, countries could integrate climate risks and the 
  cost of adaptation into their macro-fiscal frameworks. Shock scenarios are useful to reflect short-term impacts of 
  climate disasters, while the long-term analysis of risks and uncertainties surrounding climate change requires 
  scenarios that cover impacts from changes in both average and extreme events, as well as adaptation policies.

<br><strong>Planning and Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change in Fiscal Policy,</strong> March 2022, <strong>

Adaptation to climate change is an integral part of sustainable development and a necessity for advanced and developing 
  economies alike. How can adaptation be planned for and mainstreamed into fiscal policy? Setting up inclusive 
  coordination mechanisms and strengthening legal foundations to incorporate climate change can be a prerequisite. 
  This Note identifies four building blocks: 1- Taking stock of present and future climate risks, identifying 
  knowledge and capacity gaps, and establishing guidance for next steps. 2- Developing adaptation solutions. This block 
  can be guided by extending the IMF three-pillar disaster resilience strategy to address changes in both extreme and 
  average weather and would cover the prevention of risks, the alleviation of residual risks, and macro-fiscal resilience. 
  3- Mainstreaming these solutions into government operations. This requires strengthening public financial management 
  institutions by factoring climate risks and adaptation plans into budgets and macro-frameworks, and in the management 
  of public investment, assets and liabilities. 4- Providing for transparent evaluations to inform future plans. This 
  involves continually monitoring progress and regularly updating adaptation plans.

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing policymakers worldwide, and the stakes are particularly high 
  for Asia and the Pacific. This paper analyzes how fiscal policy can address challenges from climate change in Asia 
  and the Pacific. It aims to answer how policymakers can best promote mitigation, adaptation, and the transition to a 
  low-carbon economy, emphasizing the economic and social implications of reforms, potential policy trade-offs, and 
  country circumstances. The recommendations are grounded in quantitative analysis using country-specific estimates, 
  and granular household, industry, and firm-level data.

This chapter argues that governments need to scale up public investment to ensure successful reopening, boost growth, 
  and prepare economies for the future. Low interest rates make borrowing to invest desirable. Countries that cannot 
  access finance will, however, need to do more with less. The chapter explains how investment can be scaled up while 
  preserving quality. Increasing public investment by 1 percent of GDP in advanced and emerging economies could create 
  7 million jobs directly, and more than 20 million jobs indirectly. Investments in healthcare, housing, digitalization, 
  and the environment would lay the foundations for a more resilient and inclusive economy.

Haiti is one of the poorest and most unequal societies globally. This paper provides an
overview of the current social context in Haiti and coverage and effectiveness of social
safety nets. Existing social programs suffer from volatile financing and are fragmented,
poorly targeted, and undermined by weak governance. As a new national policy on
social protection and development is being prepared by the government, this paper
builds on the literature and lessons from recent experiences to examine policy options to
effectively reduce poverty and inequality. It argues in favor of a comprehensive strategy
focused on a few quasi-universal cash transfer programs with simple demographic
and/or geographic targeting. The programs must include systematic annual reports and
be supported by a communications strategy and sustainable financing plans.

After close to two decades of strong economic activity, overall growth in sub-Saharan Africa decelerated 
  markedly in 2015–16 as the largest economies experienced negative or flat growth. Regional growth started 
  recovering in 2017, but the question remains of how trends in the economies stuck in low gear will spill 
  over to the countries that have maintained robust growth. This note illuminates the discussion by identifying 
  growth spillover channels. The focus is on trade, banking, financial, remittance, investment, fiscal, and 
  security channels, which are the most prominent and most likely to transmit growth trends across borders. 
  In addition to bringing together findings from a broad array of existing research, the note identifies 
  countries that are the most likely sources of regional spillovers and those that are most likely to be 
  impacted, and provides estimates for the size of these channels. It finds that intraregional trade and 
  remittance flows are an important channel for growth spillovers, while banking channels are less important 
  but will remain a risk going forward. Finally, the note documents other important spillover channels through 
  financial markets contagion, revenue-sharing arrangements in fiscal unions, commodity-pricing policies, 
  corporate investment, and forced migration. The main takeaway is that the level of interdependence among 
  sub-Saharan countries is higher than is generally assumed. Consequently, there is a need for additional 
  emphasis on regional surveillance and spillover analysis, along with traditional bilateral surveillance.</div>
