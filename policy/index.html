This chapter argues that governments need to scale up public investment to ensure successful reopening, boost growth, and prepare economies for the future. Low interest rates make borrowing to invest desirable. Countries that cannot access finance will, however, need to do more with less. The chapter explains how investment can be scaled up while preserving quality. Increasing public investment by 1 percent of GDP in advanced and emerging economies could create 7 million jobs directly, and more than 20 million jobs indirectly. Investments in healthcare, housing, digitalization, and the environment would lay the foundations for a more resilient and inclusive economy.

Haiti is one of the poorest and most unequal societies globally. This paper provides an
overview of the current social context in Haiti and coverage and effectiveness of social
safety nets. Existing social programs suffer from volatile financing and are fragmented,
poorly targeted, and undermined by weak governance. As a new national policy on
social protection and development is being prepared by the government, this paper
builds on the literature and lessons from recent experiences to examine policy options to
effectively reduce poverty and inequality. It argues in favor of a comprehensive strategy
focused on a few quasi-universal cash transfer programs with simple demographic
and/or geographic targeting. The programs must include systematic annual reports and
be supported by a communications strategy and sustainable financing plans.

After close to two decades of strong economic activity, overall growth in sub-Saharan Africa decelerated markedly in 2015â€“16 as the largest economies experienced negative or flat growth. Regional growth started recovering in 2017, but the question remains of how trends in the economies stuck in low gear will spill over to the countries that have maintained robust growth. This note illuminates the discussion by identifying growth spillover channels. The focus is on trade, banking, financial, remittance, investment, fiscal, and security channels, which are the most prominent and most likely to transmit growth trends across borders. In addition to bringing together findings from a broad array of existing research, the note identifies countries that are the most likely sources of regional spillovers and those that are most likely to be impacted, and provides estimates for the size of these channels. It finds that intraregional trade and remittance flows are an important channel for growth spillovers, while banking channels are less important but will remain a risk going forward. Finally, the note documents other important spillover channels through financial markets contagion, revenue-sharing arrangements in fiscal unions, commodity-pricing policies, corporate investment, and forced migration. The main takeaway is that the level of interdependence among sub-Saharan countries is higher than is generally assumed. Consequently, there is a need for additional emphasis on regional surveillance and spillover analysis, along with traditional bilateral surveillance.</div>
